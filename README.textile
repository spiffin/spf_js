h1. spf_js

p. *I'm no longer able to develop this plugin due to ill health. If anyone would like to take over, message me, and I'll transfer the source.*

p. JavaScript management plugin for "Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.com/.

p. Create, edit and delete scripts in Textpattern admin and export on save to external files.

p. REQUIRES: *Texpattern 4.5.1* and PHP 5.

p. Please read the instructions and notes below before use.

p. A combination of two previously-released plugins: stm_javascript by Stanislav MÃ¼ller and rvm_css by Ruud van Melick. Thanks to the original authors and to Jukka (Gocom) and Stef (Bloke) for invaluable feedback.

p. Features include exporting scripts as files to a directory, optional "type" attribute @type="text/javascript"@ and changing the tag argument from @n=@ to @name=@ to bring it in line with default "css syntax":https://www.scaler.com/topics/css/css-syntax/.

p. Re-written for Textpattern 4.7*

p. *For Textpattern 4.4.1 and below use "this version":https://github.com/spiffin/spf_js/blob/master/spf_js_0.41.txt.*

p. "DOWNLOAD":https://raw.github.com/spiffin/spf_js/master/spf_js.txt



h2. Instructions:

# Create a directory for the static JavaScript files in the root of your textpattern installation. You should make sure that <span class="caps">PHP</span> is able to write to that directory.
# Visit the Advanced Preferences (Admin > Preferences > Advanced) and make sure the "JavaScript directory" preference contains the directory you created in step 1 (by default 'js'). This path is relative path to the directory of your root Textpattern installation.
# Activate this plugin.
# Go to Presentation > JavaScript and create JavaScripts you'd like to embed within your page templates.
# JavaScript files are stored in the database (for easy management and editing) and, on save, exported to a directory in your website where they can be referenced (as external JavaScript) with the tag below.


h2. Tags:

@<txp:spf_js /> (embeds the default JavaScript file)@

@<txp:spf_js name="myscript" /> (embeds the JavaScript file named "myscript")@

h3. HTML output:

@<script src="http://mysite.com/js/myscript.js"></script>@

h3. "type" attribute

p. By default the plugin outputs a script tag without the ""type" attribute":http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_script.asp (required in XHTML/HTML4 but optional in HTML5).

p. To include a "type" attribute just use the @type="1"@ argument:

@<txp:spf_js name="myscript" type="1" />@

p. Outputs:

@<script type="text/javascript" src="http://mysite.com/js/myscript.js"></script>@



h2. Notes:

# Don't use non-alphanumeric characters in script names (if you try to they'll be stripped).
# The plugin will convert your script names to lowercase.
# The plugin will throw an error if you try to embed a non-existent script - similar to: @Tag error:   ->  Textpattern Notice: The requested resource was not found. "script_name"@.
# &mdash; In which case check the script exists and your embed tag for typos.


h2. stm_javascript

p. If stm_javascript is installed and activated you will see two JavaScript tabs in Presentation - one named 'Javascript' (stm_javascript - with lowercase 's') and another 'JavaScript' (spf_js - uppercase 'S'). You can copy and paste scripts from stm_javascript to spf_js - and then disable stm_javascript. It's not advisable to run both plugins simultaneously.



h2. Language support (Textpack)

p. This plugin uses an English Textpack by default and installs French (fr-fr), German (de-de) and Italian (it-it) Textpacks.

p. To use your own language see the "spf_js_textpack":https://raw.github.com/spiffin/spf_js/master/spf_js_textpack.txt file in this repository.
